## Configuration

The site is configured to:
- Fetch the main README.md from the project root
- Use the `/fjell-registry/` base path for GitHub Pages
- Support dark theme code highlighting
- Include responsive breakpoints for mobile devices

## Contributing

The documentation site automatically reflects changes to the main README.md file. To update the site itself:

1. Make changes to the React components in `src/`
2. Test locally with `pnpm run dev`
3. Commit your changes
4. The site will automatically deploy via GitHub Actions
